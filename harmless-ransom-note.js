// function that takes 2 parameters: 1, the note (a String) and 2, the
// 'magazine' text (also a String) that may have words needed to compose the note
// --if the magazine has enough of the proper words to compose the note it should
// return true, and if not, should return false (note that each word from the
// magazine text can only be used once!)

// i.e. NOTE: 'this is a secret note for you from a secret admirer'
// MAGAZINE TEXT: 'puerto rico IS A great place YOU must hike FAR FROM town to find
// A SECRET waterfall that i am an ADMIRER of but note that it is not as hard as it
// seems THIS is my advice for you'
// => returns false because 'SECRET' is found only one time inside the magazine text
